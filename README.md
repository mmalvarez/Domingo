## Domingo

This package contains a deck-building card game, made in Elm
(with a bit of nodejs/express/sockets on the backend).


## Prerequisites

You'll need Elm (tested against 0.17.1) to build the web-app,
and node.js (tested against 4.2.6) to serve it.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/mmalvarez/Domingo
cd Domingo
make
```

This will run <tt>elm-make</tt> to build <tt>Domingo.js</tt>,
the part of the client generated by Elm. Once you've done this,
Domingo is built.

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```
cd Domingo/src
node app.js
```

The server runs on port 3000 by default. This can
be changed by editing app.js

### Running the Client/Connecting

Once the server is started, point your browser to

```
http://host:3000
```

where <tt>host</tt> is the computer the server is running on
(if running locally, it's probably <tt>localhost</tt>)
